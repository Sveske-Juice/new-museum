# New Archaeological Museum of Cyprus

This project was developed in association with [Emphasys Centre](https://emphasyscentre.com/) at the [Designing disruptive experiences - VR, AR and Gamification course](https://emphasyscentre.com/2023/11/01/ka1-course-designing-disruptive-experiences-vr-ar-and-gamification-3).
